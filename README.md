The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  
The output directory has txt files saved for reproductivity.

In this project, we paired nomination and inauguration speeches with campaign slogans for U.S. Presidents and candidates. We tried to anwser the question: how are these speeches related to the slogans? The idea comes of several aspects: whether the words are highly coincided, whether the sentences are of similar length and whether the emotions of sentences are alike. The results are shown in the html file.
