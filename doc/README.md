In this project, we paired nomination and inauguration speeches with campaign slogans for U.S. Presidents and candidates. We tried to anwser the question: how are these speeches related to the slogans? The idea comes of several aspects: whether the words are highly coincided, whether the sentences are of similar length and whether the emotions of sentences are alike. The results are shown in the html file.
